# DataJoint SciOps Roadmap Brainstorm

The DataJoint team in collaboration with the Johns Hopkins University Applied PHysics Lab  will hold a three-day workshop to roadmap the develop of the automated research workflows in neuroscience.
The workshop will be held at the [DataJoint office in Houston, TX](https://www.datajoint.com/about)

The workshop will identify general directions for addressing the challenges in team science and data-driven research workflows in neuroscience. 

Day 1 and Day 2 will focus on the roadmap for the field. 
Day 3 will focus on the roadmap for the DataJoint SciOps platform. 

## Day 1 - September 6

* Aim for SciOps
  - reduce barriers for participation
    - time, access, distance, and interdisciplinary
  - accelerate and scale research to tackle new kinds of problems
  - maximize opportunity for discovery

* Challenges in current neuroscience research workflows
  - The structure of typical and highly successful projects
  - Advanced neurotechnologies and multi-modal experiments
  - Data acquisition and aggregation
  - Team organization
  - IT Infrastructure - Use of cloud
  - Collaborative analysis
  - Reproducibility, integrity, continuity

* An overview of  current and emerging  neuroinformatics initiatives
  - Data standards 
  - Analysis Tools 
  - Collaboration platforms


## Day 2 - September 7
* Roadmap for Automated Research Workflows in neuroscience

## Day 3 - September 8
