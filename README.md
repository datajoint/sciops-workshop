###  Focus 
Aim 
  * to vastly increase the speed, scale, and validity of neuroscience research
  * to provide a clear competitive advantage to researchers
    - time to launch
    - high-performance computing
    - latest analysis tools
    - ability to collaborate
    - time to publish 

Solution: [Research Workflow Automation](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/26532)
 - reduce barriers to participation / collaboration
 - expand capabilities -> tackle new problems
 - ease access to cyberinfrastructure
 - transparency and reproducibility
 - integration of diverse tools and resources
 - proper incentives and credit assignment

What is needed to implement automated workflows in neuroscience
 - framework + tools = a language for formal workflows = **DataJoint Core**
 - reference implementations + integrations = **DataJoint Elements**
 - community + support + resources + services = **DataJoint Works**


DataJoint is leading efforts to disseminate automated research workflows in neuroscience by providing a formal framework and a rich collection of reference implementations for common types of experiments. 
Working with leading research teams, DataJoint integrates popular open-source software and neuroinformatics resources such as atlases and archives. 
We invite teams to collaborate on advancing new types of experiments.

The DataJoint team and the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab will hold a two-day workshop to define the roadmap for automated research workflows in neuroscience.


Breakfast and lunch will be provided. 

The workshop will identify general directions for addressing the challenges in team science and data-driven research workflows. 
Day 1 and Day 2 will map the current trends and challenges in the field.  
This session will  be open to interested researchers -- please notify Dimitri Yatsenko August 25, 2022 if you would like to attend. 
DataJoint will provide coffee and lunch and arrange the meeting space.

Day 3 will focus on the roadmap for the emerging DataJoint SciOps platform and will be limited to the DataJoint and JHU/APL teams.
